# 🌟 Legendary Races Framework (LRF)

A unified foundation for creating complex, legendary race mods for RimWorld that extend beyond standard race implementations.

## 📜 Overview

The Legendary Races Framework (LRF) enables the creation of race mods with unique mechanics, buildings, abilities, and gameplay elements while maintaining consistency and compatibility. The framework builds upon Vanilla Expanded Framework (VEF) as its core dependency and offers optional integration with Humanoid Alien Races (HAR) for expanded body customization.

2. **Consistency** - Ensure all legendary races follow similar patterns and quality standards
3. **Integration** - Seamless compatibility with vanilla game systems and popular mods
4. **Uniqueness** - Enable truly distinctive gameplay for each legendary race
5. **Maintainability** - Minimize redundant code across race mods
6. **Balance** - Provide tools and guidelines for maintaining gameplay balance
7. **Performance** - Ensure race mechanics don't adversely impact game performance
