# Legendary Races Framework (LRF)
## Comprehensive Design Document

## üìú Overview & Vision

The Legendary Races Framework (LRF) serves as a unified foundation for creating complex, legendary race mods that extend beyond standard race implementations. Each race will feature unique mechanics, buildings, abilities, and gameplay elements while maintaining consistency and compatibility. The framework builds upon Vanilla Expanded Framework (VEF) as its core dependency and offers optional integration with Humanoid Alien Races (HAR) for expanded body customization.

## üéØ Core Design Goals

1. **Extensibility** - Provide clean extension points for each legendary race
2. **Consistency** - Ensure all legendary races follow similar patterns and quality standards
3. **Integration** - Seamless compatibility with vanilla game systems and popular mods
4. **Uniqueness** - Enable truly distinctive gameplay for each legendary race
5. **Maintainability** - Minimize redundant code across race mods
6. **Balance** - Provide tools and guidelines for maintaining gameplay balance
7. **Performance** - Ensure race mechanics don't adversely impact game performance
